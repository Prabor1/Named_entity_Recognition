# Named_entity_Recognition

Here I performed Named Entity Recognition using Keras with TF. The dataset consists of some category,     
+ geo = Geographical Entity
+ org = Organization
+ per = Person
+ gpe = Geopolitical Entity
+ tim = Time indicator
+ art = Artifact
+ eve = Event
+ nat = Natural Phenomenon     

After the preprocessing of the data I used a Bidirectional LSTM model to train it.
